This project is done by

- **Amal K Santhosh**
- **Shahitha S.**

-of 2nd yr MCA , TKMCE.

## Aim

The main of this project was to write automated test cases for a web application we have created.

## Technologies used

The technologies used in this project includes:
- Selenium WebDriver
- Eclipse IDE for Java
- Chrome driver for Google Chrome
- Java for test scripts
- HTML,PHP,MySQL for the web app

## Selenium

Selenium is an umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries that enable and support the automation of web browsers. It provides extensions to emulate user interaction with browsers, a distribution server for scaling browser allocation, and the infrastructure for implementations of the  W3C WebDriver specification that lets you write interchangeable code for all major web browsers. It is made possible by volunteer contributors who have put in thousands of hours of their own time, and made the source code freely available  for anyone to use, enjoy, and improve. Selenium brings together browser vendors, engineers, and enthusiasts to further an open discussion around automation of the web platform. The project organises  an annual conference to teach and nurture the community.


## Eclipse

**Eclipse**is an integrated development environment(IDE) used in computer programming . It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug in system for customizing the environment.Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is to developing java applications , but it may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages via plug ins , including Ada , ABAP , C , C++ , C# , Clojure , COBOL , D , Erlang , Fortran , Groovy , Haskell , JavaScript , Julia , Lasso , Lua , NATURAL , Perl , PHP , Prolog , Python , R , Ruby , Rust , Scala and Scheme . It can also be used to develop documents with LaTex and packages for the software Mathematica . Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala , Eclipse CDT for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for PHP among others.

## Testcases we conducted

We did mainly 3 test cases in this project
- Login test
   - Here we were testing the code for log in into the application
- Registration test
    - Here we were testing to see if we can register complaints in a particular section.
- Adding data test
    - Some sample data was added to the database with test scripts to see if we can add users to the system. 

## Result of test cases

In all the 3 test cases we were able to automate the process and was able to move through the application and execute things automatically.The time limit given between each step was enough for us to see what the script was doing to the application.


## Repository and files

All the files that were created or used in this project where uploaded to github repository and its link is: https://github.com/ananduv2/Selenium.git

The application used for testing was made by ourselves in the 3rd semester of our MCA course and it can be found in the github repository whose link is : https://github.com/ananduv2/civil-supplies-complaint-handling-forum.git 

## Research on Topics

It was difficult at first to get proper guidance or knowledge at first as whatever materials we referred was made 4-5 years ago and was outdated. Most of the research was based on youtube videos from Edureka . We had also a little help from our seniors who guided us get the necessary materials to start our project. 

## Hurdles we faced

Through out the working of this project we faced so many hurdles and we are mentioning some of them over here
- Since this is a group project and since the team cannot meet in person to discuss about the project or work together it was bit of a challenge.
- Lack of proper net connections
- Most of the tutorial videos available or that we referred were made  4-5 years ago and was outdated in comparison with the updates of the tools used.
